          <H2>MEET NAOMI</H2>
              <p> <BR>I'm Naomi I'm English and born in the beautiful town of Bridgnorth in Shropshire.<BR><BR>
              I was very lucky to have gone on a few family holidays as a child and my nana and pops had a beautiful caravan in Wales which we visited a lot when I was little.
              I always knew I wanted to travel, I just loved going to new places and seeing how different it was, especially eating the food!.<BR><BR>
              The first place I went to by myself at 20 was New Zealand which was absolutely beautiful, 100% recommend going. After that I just caught the itch, thank goodness Kevin also had the same itch. <BR><BR>
              Over the last few years, I became obsessed with van life, I bought my first van which I named (italics)Jennie in 2018, which turned out to be the worst thing I ever did, it Brooke down everytime I drove and after pulling out the interior to build my own there were more holes than metal. 
              Then covid hit and I managed to convince Kevin to buy another van. Which is Wilson! 
              I love the idea of living from with just a few items but having everything you need and making anywhere your garden. 
              After watching many YouTubers build there van and go Travelling we decided to do the same.<BR><BR>
              I am beyonded grateful that this dream is actually finally happening after many years of saving and building dreaming </p>

              <H2>MEET KEVIN</H2>
              <p> <BR>Hi I am Kevin. I was born in The Netherlands in a town called Apeldoorn. I moved to Northampton in the UK when I was 3. <br><br>
                I have always had a passion for visiting new places and learning about different cultures from a young age.
               I was lucky enough to visit some really cool countries so far. <br><br>
               My first big trip, that I remember, was going to South Africa when I was 7, going on a real safari and climbing tabletop mountain is unreal to see anyway but espacialy for a 7year old!.
              I then spent 3-months living in Sierra Leone when I was 11 this was an amazing experience and taught me, at a young age, how different people live in different countries. <br><br>
              Go forward about 8-years and my good friend and I InterRailed across Europe covering most of Western Europe and some part of the east. This again was eye-opening and from there my travel bug just stuck with me.<br><br>
              Since meeting Naomi and us both loving travel we have had some great adventures so far driving all the way around Iceland in -11 in a very small campervan. As well as chilling on a beachs in Dominican Republic. <br><br>
              In my spare time you will find me bouldering, walking the dog or enjoying my geeky hobby of plane spotting. However at the moment I'm mostly in Wilson trying to fix something. </p>

              <H2>MEET DILYS</H2>
              <p><br>I'm Dilys and I'm a Romanian rescue, I was found by my rescuers Amicci  at around 4 weeks old with my mum and my two siblings.<br><br>
               I waited till I got a bit bigger and came all the way to the UK to live with Kevin and Naomi. <Br><br>
                My nickname is Foxy, because when i sleep i look like a little fox<br>
              I love to play with my ball and go swimming although waves scare me a bit. You'll always find me chaseing squirels or playing tuggy with my firends.<br><br>
              I love to meet new friends and play chase with other dogs and humans. Especially if you give my tummy rubs.

              <H2>MEET WILSON</H2>
              <p> <br>This is Wilson. <br>
                He is a Volkswagen LT35 he was born in 1993. He's had a few owners through his years and that they have all tried to convert him from one state to another. <br><br>
                The guy we got him off used the van for his fishing weekends away and he said he was selling him because it was just a bit too slow.
                 However we think it's probably because the alternator was broken. Something we found out when we tried to fill up gas after purchasing him, and had to jump-start him straight away.<br><br>
                The reason we decided to get a LT is because we have a love for rusty old Volkswagens.
                  Our first rusty old Volkswagen was Jenny, a lovely T25 that leaked and had no interior, but you couldnt help but fall in love with her. Unfortunately fixing her to a good standard would have cost way too much and she wasn't really big enough before a trip around the world.<br><br>
                  Luckily Wilson came along and although he had a few issues that needed to be fixed, a bit of welding that also needed to be sorted. We saw that he could be a great van. A little slow up hills or anywhere, for that matter.
                  but he just has such a charm about him. We can wait for him to take us all through europe!</p>
