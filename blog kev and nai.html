    <a href="Blog_post_How_to_insulate.html" class="blog-title">How we Insulated Wilson the van</a>
    <p>The first job with the insulation was to batton the floor. We did this using just timber we got from b&q is was Â£30 for 5 lenghts of you we battened along the areas where we need the beds and the cupboards were going to go go as well as anywhere where we would be standing quite a lot. Preclude this in using some multi-purpose glue that we just found at any hardware store and we found that this did the trick although we did need to wait down for a few hours to make sure it was stuck down properly. We then used insert name of insulation here which we cut into the right sizes and just pushed in in to the boxes made by the batten. After this we worked on the ceilings using the same insulation we had to be careful to avoid the bars going across the roof due to the curvature of the roof we also so had to cut sections into the insulation so that it would conform nicely. We used the spikes especially made for holding insulation which had sticky back on it which we could stick straight to the fibreglass roof and then we simply spiked through LU2 the insulation which then held it up nicely meaning we didn't need any glue. Once insulation was up a metal plate was slid over the remaining end of the spike and the spike cut off this then held insulation in place although we must say that some of the spikes sticky back failed and is probably just being held up by cladding right now. The walls was by far the most frustrating bit for our insulation stage at first we used fibreglass insulation which we had gotten for free ree-ann dwie all but finished insulating the whole van when we realised from watching videos that this was not the correct material to use due to holding moisture which would cause rust. So after 2 weeks of fitting that all we had to rip it out and replace it with recycled plastic insulation this is something that is easily available at places like b&q and Wickes but it's worth hunting around as local places may do it for cheaper. Once we got this installation and all the nooks and crannies we then use the foil wrap over it it and made sure that we foil typed any areas to try and get an airtight seal. The roof and the floor areas were also tapped to make sure that nothing could get into the insulation or make it damp.</p>
